**** What is OCaml Batteries ****

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library for your OCaml projecs.


**** What is it good for ****

Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

**** Errors ****

ERROR: omake: Symbol `FamErrlist' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking

This error is caused when using Gamin rather than Fam; omake is
probably linked against libfam.  libgamin is compatible and works; the
error does not cause a problem and can be ignored?  Switching from
Gamin to Fam can break things in some situations (e.g. AFS home
directories).

If you really want to get rid of the warning, on an Ubuntu based OS,
run the following command:

	sudo apt-get install libfam0
