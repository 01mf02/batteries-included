This directory contains the core of Batteries Included, i.e.
* INRIA's base library
* Extlib
* Findlib (1)
* Sexplib (1)

To use it from within Batteries, open either module Batteries_core or
module Batteries_core_nothreads, for respectively the
thread-compatible or non-threaded version.

From the outside of Batteries, you don't need to know about these
modules.
