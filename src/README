This directory contains all the source code for OCaml Batteries Included.

* core/   contains the core of Batteries Included (the Base Library, ExtLib
  and extensions to ExtLib), as well as a little more (that last part will
  probably move to a new subdirectory of src/ at some point)
* main/   contains wrappers around the contents of core/, forming the libraries
  visible from the outside
* syntax/ contains several syntax extensions for OCaml
