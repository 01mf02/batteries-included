<h1>The toplevel</h1>
</center>

If you are new to OCaml, the best place to start is probably the <emph>toplevel</emph>,
a minimal interactive environment in which you may write OCaml code and evaluate it
immediately, without having to go through a compilation process.

<h2>Launching the toplevel<a name="launching"/></h2>
To launch the toplevel from a terminal, open a terminal
and write
<pre class="example">
ocamlfind batteries/ocaml
</pre>

If you have one of the tools rlwrap or ledit installed (either of
which is strongly suggested), open a terminal and, instead of the
previous command, write either
<pre class="example">
rlwrap ocamlfind batteries/ocaml
</pre>
or
<pre class="example">
ledit ocamlfind batteries/ocaml
</pre>

Finally, if you have Emacs and Tuareg, which is even more suggested,
instead of the previous commands, open Emacs, open a file whose
name ends with <code>.ml</code>, press <code>&langle;Ctrl&rangle;-S</code>
and, when Emacs asks you for the name of your OCaml toplevel, answer
<pre class="example">
ocamlfind batteries/ocaml
</pre>

<h2>What is the toplevel?<a name="what"/></h2> 

You can think of the top-level as a very powerful calculator or as a
command-line interface comparable to that of your operating system.
The role of this top-level waits for your commands, evaluates them and
prints results. This makes it a nice way a to learn OCaml and to test
algorithms and data structures.

<br />

When you launch the toplevel, it displays something along the lines of:
