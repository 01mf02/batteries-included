<center><h1>Installing Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>The GODI package manager</h2></center>
<p>
At the moment, on most computers, the easiest manner of installing
OCaml Batteries Included on your computer is to take advantage
of <a href="http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html">GODI
</a>, a package manager specifically dedicated to OCaml. You will
first need to install GODI, if GODI isn't install on your machine yet,
then to select package <code>batteries</code> in the list of packages
and accept the decisions of GODI. This should take care of installing
OCaml Batteries Included for you.
</p>
<p>
Note that producing the documentation is long (typically 10-15 minutes).
</p>

<center><h2>Fedora / Debian / Red Hat / Ubuntu</h2></center>
<center>At the time of this writing, this method is experimental.</center>
<p>
On Fedora / Debian / Red Hat / Ubuntu stations,
packages <emph>may</emph> be able for Batteries. If this is the case,
to install OCaml Batteries Included, just run your usual package
manager (generally either Synaptic, Yum, KPackage, Aptitude or
DSelect), and select package <code>libbatteries-ocaml-dev</code>.
This should take care of installing OCaml Batteries Included for you.
</p>

<center><h2>Manually</h2></center>
<p>
To perform installation of OCaml Batteries Included manually, please make sure
that you have already installed all the following tools and libraries:
</p>
<ul>
<li>OCaml itself</li>
<li>Findlib</li>
<li>Type-conv</li>
<li>Camomile, version 0.7 or greater</li>
<li>Sexplib</li>
<li>Bin-prot</li>
<li>GNU Make</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once all these libraries are installed, you may download and uncompress the latest version
of OCaml Batteries Included, enter the directory produced by decompression and invoke
<pre>
make byte opt doc install
</pre>
to build and install both the byte-code version, the native version
and the documentation of OCaml Batteries Included. If you are not
interested in respectively the byte-code version, the native version
or the documentation of OCaml Batteries Included, just omit
respectively <code>byte</code>, <code>opt</code> or <code>doc</code>
from that command.
</p>

<p>
Note that producing the documentation is long (typically 10-15 minutes).

<center><h1>Using Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>Simple method (using OCamlBuild)</h2></center>
To use Batteries Included, the easiest solution is to take 
advantage of both findlib and ocamlbuild. OCamlBuild is part
of your installation of OCaml and findlib is generally installed
by default, too.
<br />
If you have both OCaml and findlib, the simple method is to
take the following steps:
<ol>
<li>in your project directory, copy file 
  <a href="../myocamlbuild.ml"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
  (don't rename it, it must be called <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code>)</li>
<li>still in your project directory, modify your file called 
  <tt>_tags</tt> (if it doesn't exist yet, create it) to add the following line
  <code>
      &lt;*&gt;: use_batteries
  </code></li>
</ol>

That should be it. For more informations on the contents of Batteries
Included, please take a look at <a href="api/index.html"
target="_top">the API documentation</a> and <a href="extensions.html">
the set of language extensions introduced by Batteries</a>.

<center><h2>Simple method (without OCamlBuild)</h2></center>
For convenience, OCaml Batteries Included also provides custom tools which
you may use instead of the regular <code>ocaml</code>, <code>ocamlc</code>,
<code>ocamlopt</code> and <code>ocamlcp</code>. To invoke these, 
<dl>
  <dt>Top-level</dt> 
  <dd>
    Write <code>ocamlfind batteries/ocaml</code> instead
    of your usual <code>ocaml</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Bytecode compiler</dt> 
  <dd>
    Write <code>ocamlfind batteries/ocamlc</code> instead
    of your usual <code>ocamlc</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Native compiler</dt> 
  <dd>
    Write <code>ocamlfind batteries/ocamlopt</code> instead
    of your usual <code>ocamlopt</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>Profiling compiler</dt> 
  <dd>
    Write <code>ocamlfind batteries/ocamlcp</code> instead
    of your usual <code>ocamlcp</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

For instance, if you want to compile the "cat" implementation
which you may find in the examples/ subdirectory, you may just
invoke
<code class="example">
ocamlfind batteries/ocamlc cat.ml
</code>
or, for building optimized native code,
<code class="example">
ocamlfind batteries/ocamlopt cat.ml
</code>
That's it.




<center><h2>More control</h2></center>
File <a href="../myocamlbuild"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
is an extension of OCamlBuild. It defines <emph>tags</emph>, which you
may use in your projects to specify that your project should take
advantage of the various features of Batteries Included. Copying this
file to your project directory is required to take advantage of these
tags.
<br />
The tags defined by Batteries Included are:
<dl>
<dt>use_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language.</dd>
<dt>use_batteries_r</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language -- in revised syntax.</dd>
<dt>pkg_threads</dt><dd>Allow threading. Required to use module <code>Control.Concurrency.Threads</code>.</dd>
<dt>pkg_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included only as a
    library. No language extension is involved.  To use the features
    of Batteries Included with <code>pkg_batteries</code>, you need to start your
    files with <code>open Batteries</code>.</dd>
<dt>use_boilerplate</dt> <dd>Use only the syntax extensions necessary
    to automatically generate boiler-plate code. These syntax extensions are
    not added by default when performing <code>use_batteries</code> as they can suddenly
    turn correct code into something which doesn't compile. Use tag
    <code>use_boilerplate</code> in conjunction with either <code>use_batteries</code> or
    <code>use_batteries_r</code>.</dd>
</dl>

To take advantage of a tag for a file or a set of files, you need to add this
tag to a speciale file named <code>_tags</code>, placed in the same directory
as your files. For instance, to have <code>my_file.ml</code> compiled with
Batteries Included as a library and <code>my_other_file.ml</code> compiled
with both the library, the language extensions and boiler-plate code, your
file <code>_tags</code> should read:
<pre>
&lt;my_file.ml&gt;: pkg_batteries
&lt;my_other_file.ml&gt;: use_batteries,use_boilerplate
</pre>

The order of lines doesn't matter, nor does the order of tags on one line. For
more informations on <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code> and <code>_tags</code>, see
<a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild">the documentation
of OCamlBuild</a>.

<center><h2>Even more control</h2></center> During its installation,
Batteries Included creates a set
of <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>
packages:

<dl>
<dt>batteries</dt> <dd>
The main package for Batteries Included. In turn, this package defines subpackages
   <dt>batteries.pa_openin.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding new possibilities for the opening of modules.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_type_conv.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding boiler-plate possibilities.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_where.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding a construction <code>where</code> dual to <code>let</code>.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_batteries.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension for automatically opening module <code>Batteries</code>.</dd>
</dd>
<dt>batteries_threads</dt> <dd>You will probably never need to manipulate this package yourself.
It is automatically linked to your files when you use both package <code>batteries</code>
and package <code>threads</code>.</dd>
<dt>batteries_nothreads</dt> <dd>You will probably never need to manipulate this package yourself.
It is automatically linked to your files when you use package <code>batteries</code>
without using package <code>threads</code>.</dd>
</dl>

For more information on how to use these packages, please see the documentation of
<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>.

<center><h2>Another method (using OMake)</h2></center>
Building a project with OMake is fairly simple.
You just need to take advantage of OMake's built-in findlib support by
adding the following to your OMakefile:
<code class="example">
USE_OCAMLFIND = true

OCAMLPACKS[] +=
   batteries.pa_openin.syntax
   batteries.pa_where.syntax
   batteries.pa_batteries.syntax
   batteries

OCAMLDEPFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o
OCAMLFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o
</code>

Here's a complete OMakefile for building the "cat" implementation you will
find under the examples/ subdirectory:

<code class="example">
USE_OCAMLFIND = true

OCAMLPACKS[] +=
   batteries.pa_openin.syntax
   batteries.pa_where.syntax
   batteries.pa_batteries.syntax
   batteries

OCAMLDEPFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o
OCAMLFLAGS += -syntax camlp4o


OCamlProgram(cat, cat)
</code>


The above OCAMLPACKS definition uses Batteries and all the non-destructive
syntax extensions available as of 2008-11-16; this corresponds to the
<code>use_batteries</code> tag in ocamlbuild.

If you only want to use Batteries as a library, without syntax extensions, use

<code class="example">
OCAMLPACKS[] += batteries
</code>

and drop the <code>OCAMLDEPFLAGS</code> and <code>OCAMLFLAGS</code>
lines in the above examples, as they are no longer needed.
