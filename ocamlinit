(**
   This file is meant to be invoked by a toplevel and performs initialization
   of OCaml Batteries Included and its libraries.

   Initialization consists of
   - loading Findlib
   - loading dependencies
   - loading the contents of the on-line help system
   - printing a welcome message

   To take advantage of this file, merge this file with your ~/.ocamlinit.
