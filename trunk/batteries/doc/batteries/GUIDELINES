GUIDELINES FOR INCLUSION OF NEW PACKAGES


** Prerequisites

A package may only be included if

* Its license is compatible
  good: LGPL + linking exception,  MIT, BSD, public domain
  bad:  GPL or bare LGPL, proprietary.

* It is documented or you are willing to write the API
  documentation yourself
  good: most of ExtLib, most of the base library, ocamldoc, Sexplib
  bad:  ocamlbuild, most of Jane Street's Core.

* It is active and has an official maintainer willing to accept bug
  reports, upstream patches... If not, there's always the option of
  volunteering to become the maintainer.

* It appears in GODI, Debian and Fedora and the package itself works
  and has a maintainer. If not, there's always the option of
  volunteering to become the maintainer. Or you can contact the Debian
  and Fedora teams, they're nice people.

* It works with Findlib. For most packages, it's already done. Adding
  findlib support is usually a trivial task but it needs to be done
  upstream. In the worst case, feel free to contribute a Findlib META-file.
