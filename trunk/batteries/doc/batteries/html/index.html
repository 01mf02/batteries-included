<h1>Welcome!</h1>

A hearty welcome to OCaml Batteries Included. 

<h1>What is OCaml Batteries Included?</h1> 

<p>
Twenty years ago, a language was just a compiler. You could measure
the quality of a language from the beauty of its semantics, the
clarity of its syntax, the speed of generated code. But that's not
true anymore. Since then, the Java and .Net nuclear plants have been
built, the Python and Ruby powerhouses have been inaugurated and they
all have demonstrated that a language can only be as beautiful, clear
and fast as the libraries which developers are actually going to use
for their work.

</p>
<p>

Unfortunately, from this point of view, OCaml lacks a bit of
electricity: yes, libraries exist for treating Unicode, producing
graphical interfaces, reading and writing XML, drawing in two or three
dimensions, building distributed programs, network services or
webservers, examining text, reading and writing images, combining
parsers, sending, storing and receiving type-safe data, performing
type analysis on complex languages, opening databases, generating
other programming languages, interfacing with industrial
platforms... But these libraries often don't work too well with each
other. If you're starting with OCaml, the only thing you can rely on
are a meager few functions on lists and strings. Oh, and
although <code>try...finally...</code> has been part of the OCaml
tutorial for ages, it's still not part of the language.

</p>
<p>

Fortunately, the OCaml community is nothing if not resourceful.
It has provided findlib to manage compile-time dependencies
and OCamlBuild to automatize compilation, GODI to complement
apt-get and yum and manage software installation and, when
the language needs to be extended, the flexible Camlp4.


</p>
<p>

Now is time to take all these tools and all the main libraries
produced by the OCaml community and turn them into a consistent
platform. That's OCaml Batteries Included.

<h1>What's inside?</h1>
Essentially, OCaml Batteries Included consists in two components:
<ul>
 <li>Libraries, themselves consisting mostly in a small uniformization layer on top of chosen existing libraries.</li>
 <li>Language extensions, themselves often consisting in chosen existing language extensions.</li>
</ul>
