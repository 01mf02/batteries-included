<center><h1>Using Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>Simple method</h2></center>
To use Batteries Included, the easiest solution is to take 
advantage of both findlib and ocamlbuild. OCamlBuild is part
of your installation of OCaml and findlib is often installed
by default, too.
<br />
If you have both OCaml and findlib, the simple method is to
take the following steps:
<ol>
<li>in your project directory, copy file 
  <a href="../myocamlbuild.ml"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
  (don't rename it, it must be called <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code>)</li>
<li>still in your project directory, modify your file called 
  <tt>_tags</tt> (if it doesn't exist yet, create it) to add the following line
  <code>
      &lt;*&gt;: use_batteries
  </code></li>
</ol>

That should be it. For more informations on the contents of Batteries
Included, please take a look at <a href="api/index.html"
target="_top">the API documentation</a> and <a href="extensions.html">
the set of language extensions introduced by Batteries</a>.

<center><h2>More control</h2></center>
File <a href="../myocamlbuild"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
is an extension of OCamlBuild. It defines <emph>tags</emph>, which you
may use in your projects to specify that your project should take
advantage of the various features of Batteries Included. Copying this
file to your project directory is required to take advantage of these
tags.
<br />
The tags defined by Batteries Included are:
<dl>
<dt>use_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language.</dd>
<dt>use_batteries_r</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language -- in revised syntax.</dd>
<dt>pkg_threads</dt><dd>Allow threading. Required to use module <code>Control.Concurrency.Threads</code>.</dd>
<dt>pkg_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included only as a
    library. No language extension is involved.  To use the features
    of Batteries Included with <code>pkg_batteries</code>, you need to start your
    files with <code>open Batteries</code>.</dd>
<dt>use_boilerplate</dt> <dd>Use only the syntax extensions necessary
    to automatically generate boiler-plate code. These syntax extensions are
    not added by default when performing <code>use_batteries</code> as they can suddenly
    turn correct code into something which doesn't compile. Use tag
    <code>use_boilerplate</code> in conjunction with either <code>use_batteries</code> or
    <code>use_batteries_r</code>.</dd>
</dl>

To take advantage of a tag for a file or a set of files, you need to add this
tag to a speciale file named <code>_tags</code>, placed in the same directory
as your files. For instance, to have <code>my_file.ml</code> compiled with
Batteries Included as a library and <code>my_other_file.ml</code> compiled
with both the library, the language extensions and boiler-plate code, your
file <code>_tags</code> should read:
<pre>
&lt;my_file.ml&gt;: pkg_batteries
&lt;my_other_file.ml&gt;: use_batteries,use_boilerplate
</pre>

The order of lines doesn't matter, nor does the order of tags on one line. For
more informations on <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code> and <code>_tags</code>, see
<a href="http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild">the documentation
of OCamlBuild</a>.

<center><h2>Even more control</h2></center> During its installation,
Batteries Included creates a set
of <a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>
packages:

<dl>
<dt>batteries</dt> <dd>
The main package for Batteries Included. In turn, this package defines subpackages
   <dt>batteries.pa_openin.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding new possibilities for the opening of modules.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_type_conv.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding boiler-plate possibilities.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_where.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension adding a construction <code>where</code> dual to <code>let</code>.</dd>
   <dt>batteries.pa_batteries.syntax</dt> <dd>A language extension for automatically opening module <code>Batteries</code>.</dd>
</dd>
<dt>batteries_threads</dt> <dd>You will probably never need to manipulate this package yourself.
It is automatically linked to your files when you use both package <code>batteries</code>
and package <code>threads</code>.</dd>
<dt>batteries_nothreads</dt> <dd>You will probably never need to manipulate this package yourself.
It is automatically linked to your files when you use package <code>batteries</code>
without using package <code>threads</code>.</dd>
</dl>

For more information on how to use these packages, please see the documentation of
<a href="http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html">findlib</a>.
