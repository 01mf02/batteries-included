<center><h1>Using Batteries Included</h1></center>
<center><h2>Simple method</h2></center>
To use Batteries Included, the easiest solution is to take 
advantage of both findlib and ocamlbuild. OCamlBuild is part
of your installation of OCaml and findlib is often installed
by default, too.
<br />
If you have both OCaml and findlib, the simple method is to
take the following steps:
<ol>
<li>in your project directory, copy file 
  <a href="../myocamlbuild.ml"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
  (don't rename it, it must be called <code>myocamlbuild.ml</code>)</li>
<li>still in your project directory, modify your file called 
  <tt>_tags</tt> (if it doesn't exist yet, create it) to add the following line
  <code>
      &lt;*&gt;: use_batteries
  </code></li>
<li>in any source file which needs to take advantage of Batteries Included,
  add <code>open Batteries</code></li>
</ol>

That should be it. For more informations on the contents of
Batteries Included, please take a look at <a href="api/index.html" target="_top">the API documentation</a>.

<center><h2>More details</h2></center>
File <a href="../myocamlbuild"><code>doc/batteries/myocamlbuild.ml</code></a>
is an extension of OCamlBuild. It defines <emph>tags</emph>, which you
may use in your projects to specify that your project should take
advantage of the various features of Batteries Included. Copying this
file to your project directory is required to take advantage of these
tags.
<br />
The tags defined by Batteries Included are:
<dl>
<dt>use_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language.</dd>
<dt>use_batteries_r</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language -- in revised syntax.</dd>
<dt>pkg_batteries</dt> <dd>Use Batteries Included both as a library and to extend the OCaml language.</dd>
</dl>
