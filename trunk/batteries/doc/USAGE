To use Batteries Included, the easiest solution is to take 
advantage of both findlib and ocamlbuild. In turn, to do
that, the easiest method is the following:

* in your project directory, copy file doc/myocamlbuild.ml (it's
  part of Batteries Included, you can find it in this directory) --
  be sure to keep the name "myocamlbuild.ml"

* still in your project directory, modify your file called "_tags"
  (if it doesn't exist yet, create it) to add the following line:
      <*>: pkg_batteries

That should be it. For more informations on the contents of
Batteries Included, please take a look at the API documentation,
available at
	  doc/api.docdir/index.html
