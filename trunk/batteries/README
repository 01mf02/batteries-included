*** Using Batteries Included ***




*** Adding a new library ***
* create a directory "juice/my_library"
* edit "juice/_tags" and add "<my_library>: include"
* edit "my_library/_tags" to add whichever options are necessary (typically "<*>: pkg_my_library")
* edit "_tags" to add whichever options are necessary (typically "<batlib.cma>: pkg_my_library"
  and "<batlib.cmxa>": pkg_my_library)
* import all the public .mli files from the library, renaming them
     Batlib_<my_library>_<module_name>.mli
* for each .mli file, add the corresponding .ml file, as per juice/template
  e.g. 
       for i in Base64 Bitset Dllist Dynarray Enum Global IO Option OptParse PMap RefList Std Unzip; 
       	   do sed -e "s/\$1/ExtLib/" -e "s/\$2/$i/" -e "s/\$3/$i/" ../template_ml > batlib_Extlib_$i.ml; 
       done
* regenerate the list of modules for documentation and generation of .cma. For this purpose, run
  "make list"
