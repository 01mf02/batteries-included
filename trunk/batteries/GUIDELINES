GUIDELINES FOR INCLUSION OF NEW PACKAGES


** Prerequisites

A package may only be included if

* Its license is compatible
  good: LGPL + linking exception,  MIT, BSD, public domain
  bad:  GPL or bare LGPL, proprietary.

* It is documented or you are willing to write the API
  documentation yourself
  good: most of ExtLib, most of the base library, ocamldoc, Sexplib
  bad:  ocamlbuild, most of Jane Street's Core.

* It is active and has an official maintainer willing to accept bug
  reports, upstream patches... If not, there's always the option of
  volunteering to become the maintainer.

* It appears in GODI (and preferably also in Debian and Fedora),
  the package works and has a maintainer. If not, there's always the
  option of volunteering to become the maintainer.

* It works with Findlib. For most packages, adding findlib support is
  trivial but it needs to be done upstream. In the worst case, feel
  free to contribute a Findlib META.


** The process

For this manual, let us consider that you are in the process of adding
a reference to package foobar.

**** Dependencies

Make sure you know everything your package depends on. These dependencies
may take the form of libraries and preprocessors.

Both go into:
* build/META            (for findlib)
* build/batteries.spec  (for GODI)

For more informations on the format of META, see [todo].
For more informations on the format of batteries.spec, see [todo].
