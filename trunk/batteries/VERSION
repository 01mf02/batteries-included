This is version 0 "Where things should have begun"
Don't expect anything flashy, this library is released
only to give an idea of how things will be organized.

This version of Batteries Included provides the skeleton for future
expansions. We have
* the Base library (i.e. the library available with Inria's OCaml distribution)
* access to OCamlDoc
* access to Findlib
* access to Godi-script
* access to Extlib

For more information on packages, see the (embryonnic) html documentation.
