ocaml-batteries (0.20090405+beta1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: add explicit dep on libbin-prot-camlp4-dev, it is a
    needed CamlP4 dep, not inferrable by dh_ocaml (Closes: #557538)

ocaml-batteries (0.20090405+beta1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get rid of TopGit for packaging, use dom-{save,apply}-patches to
    manage quilt series. Document that in README.source. Patch names are
    now as follows:
    - 0001-debian-specific-installation-paths
    - 0002-debian-specific-info-on-doc-availability
  * debian/control: clean up non-automatic OCaml deps, now that all
    build-deps have been ported to recent dh-ocaml
  * rebuild against recent sexplib, bump build-dep accordingly
    (Closes: #556034)
  * add debian/gbp.conf to enforce pristine-tar usage with gbp

ocaml-batteries (0.20090405+beta1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes needed)
    - use dh-ocaml to infer/provide dependencies, keep hand-written
      dependencies for the interim; bump build-dep on dh-ocaml to 0.9
    - clean up wrong relationships on -doc package: remove ${shlibs:Depends}
      and bogus Provides on -camlp4-dev and metapackage
  * debian/rules
    - switch {debhelper,patchsys-quilt}.mk: fix debian/*.log cleanup
    - stop using ocamldoc-api-ref-config (gone now), rather ship a
      hand-written doc-base entry (Closes: #549795)

ocaml-batteries (0.20090405+beta1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefano Zacchiroli ]

    had no reason to exist and hindered binNMU-ability)

  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2 (no changes needed)

  [ Stephane Glondu ]
  * Use new location of ocamldoc-api-ref-config
