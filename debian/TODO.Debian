- add symlink for the docs from /usr/share/doc/ocaml-batteries-included/ to the
  appropriate places (document should be accessible from there as well)
- fix the tg-export workflow so that it remembers the branch that was current
  before invoking tg-export and return to that afterwards (that enables
  invoking tg-export both from build and from master)
- register HTML API doc with docbase
