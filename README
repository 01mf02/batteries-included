*** Welcome to Batteries Included ***

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library
for your OCaml projecs.


Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* define a standard set of language extensions which
  may be expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

*** Building Batteries Included ***
You will need
* OCaml >= 3.10.2
* Findlib
* Type-conv
* Camomile >= 0.7
* Sexplib
* Bin-prot
* Camlzip
* GNU Make

If you're working from the git tree, you'll need:
* autoconf
and you'll have to first run
    $ autoconf
to create the configure script.

To install the full version of OCaml Batteries Included in the default
directory (/usr/local/), execute

    $ ./configure
    $ make all opt install install-doc

If you wish to install to a directory other than the default directory,
execute

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/some/other/directory/
    $ make all opt install install-doc

Be patient, documentation generation may take more than 15 minutes.
If you do not want the documentation generation, remove "install-doc"
from the previous commands.
