*** Welcome to Batteries Included ***

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library
for your OCaml projecs.


Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

*** Building Batteries Included ***

**** Requirements ****
You will need
* OCaml >= 3.11
* OMake (http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html)
* Findlib   (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html/)
* Camomile >= 0.7 (http://camomile.sourceforge.net/)
* OUnit    to build and run the tests

**** Configuration and installation ****

To install the full version of OCaml Batteries Included in the default
directory (/usr/local/), execute

   $ omake all doc install install-doc

To test your install, execute

   $ omake test

*** Using AAA Batteries ***

To get started using AAA-batteries at the toplevel, copy the ocamlinit
file to ~/.ocamlinit:

   $ cp ocamlinit ~/.ocamlinit

If you already have findlib in your ~/.ocamlinit, you only need the
last line in our ocamlinit to load batteries.

*** ExtLib Compatibility ***

If your project currently uses ExtLib, most likely you can just change
[-package extlib] to [-package aaa] and add [open Extlibcompat] to the
top of any extlib-using modules.  Batteries' modules are all named
BatFoo to differentiate them from extlib's modules, so one can use
Batteries and ExtLib in the same project.  

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: If you're using ExtLib's Unzip module, it does not
have a corresponding module in batteries at the moment.

*** Extending Batteries Included ***

See doc/batteries/GUIDELINES (may apply to AAA-batteries)
