*** Welcome to Batteries Included ***

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library
for your OCaml projecs.


Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

*** Building Batteries Included ***

**** Requirements ****
You will need
* OCaml >= 3.10.2 (preferably OCaml >= 3.11)
* OMake
* Findlib   (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html/)
* Camomile >= 0.7 (http://camomile.sourceforge.net/)
* Camlzip   (http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html#camlzip)
   ( Note: By default, the distribution of Camlzip is not quite sufficient for actual use.
     We provide the missing files in directory camlzip/ .)
* Ocamlnet  2.2.9 (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html)
* OUnit    to build and run the tests

**** Configuration and installation ****

To install the full version of OCaml Batteries Included in the default
directory (/usr/local/), execute

   $ omake all doc install install-doc

To test your install, execute

   $ omake test
