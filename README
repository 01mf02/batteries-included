*** Welcome to Batteries Included ***

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library
for your OCaml projecs.


Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

*** Building Batteries Included ***

**** Requirements ****
You will need
* OCaml >= 3.11
* OMake (http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html)
* Findlib   (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html/)
* Camomile >= 0.7 (http://camomile.sourceforge.net/)
* Camlzip   (http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html#camlzip)
   ( Note: By default, the distribution of Camlzip is not quite 
     sufficient for actual use.  We provide the missing files in 
     the directory camlzip/. )
* OUnit    to build and run the tests

**** Configuration and installation ****

To install the full version of OCaml Batteries Included in the default
directory (/usr/local/), execute

   $ omake all doc install install-doc


To test your install, execute

   $ omake test


*** Using AAA Batteries ***

To get started using AAA-batteries at the toplevel, copy the ocamlinit
file to ~/.ocamlinit:

   $ cp ocamlinit ~/.ocamlinit

If your project currently uses ExtLib, most likely you can just change
[-package extlib] to [-package aaa] and you'll be using AAA-batteries.
If your project depends on libraries that depend on extlib, you'll
have to use [-package extlib,aaa-extlibcompat] and continue to use
ExtLib, but also be able to use much of AAA.

*** Extending Batteries Included ***

See doc/batteries/GUIDELINES (may apply to AAA-batteries)
