*** Welcome to Batteries Included ***

OCaml Batteries Included: a community-maintained foundation library
for your OCaml projecs.


Batteries Included serves the following purposes:
* define a standard set of libraries which may be
  expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules,
  with one source of documentation
* define a standard set of language extensions which
  may be expected on every compliant installation of OCaml
* provide a consistent API for otherwise independent
  libraries.

*** Building Batteries Included ***

**** Requirements ****
You will need
* OCaml >= 3.10.2 (preferably OCaml >= 3.11)
* GNU Make
* Findlib   (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html/)
* Type-conv (http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html)
* Sexplib  >= 3.7.5 if you're using OCaml 3.11
           <  3.7.5 if you're using OCaml 3.10 (http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html)
* Bin-prot  (http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html)
* Camomile >= 0.7 (http://camomile.sourceforge.net/)
* Camlzip   (http://cristal.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html#camlzip)
   ( Note: By default, the distribution of Camlzip is note quite sufficient for actual use.
     We provide the missing files in directory camlzip/ .)
* Ocamlnet  2.2.9 (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html)
* OUnit    to build and run the tests

**** Pre-configuration ****

If you have downloaded Batteries Included from the official download page or from
a mirror, you may skip this step. It is only required for adventurous people who
have downloaded Batteries Included from the git repository.

In this case, you will also need

* autoconf

Before proceeding to configuration and installation, you will need to run

    $ autoconf

This will create some files which are necessary for the next step.


**** Configuration and installation ****

To install the full version of OCaml Batteries Included in the default
directory (/usr/local/), execute

    $ ./configure
    $ make all opt top syntax install install-doc

If you wish to install to a directory other than the default directory,
execute

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/some/other/directory/
    $ make all opt top syntax install install-doc

Be patient, documentation generation may take more than 15 minutes.
If you do not want the documentation generation, remove "install-doc"
from the previous commands.
